### Welcome to my GitHub profile

[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=jeremylevasseur&theme=dark)](https://github.com/jeremylevasseur/github-readme-streak-stats)

I am currently in my final semester of Engineering at Carleton University and I am on the hunt for a full time job starting in May 2021.

At the same time as being in school, I am doing freelance software development for individuals and small businesses.

I have experience in mobile development for Android and iOS. I also can create interactive web applications using React.

Ubuntu Focal is my preffered development environment. I then use Docker to run the various applications required within containers. Using this technique makes deployment and the continuous integration of new code very easy.

My favourite languages are Python and JavaScript, but I use Java and Swift often due to mobile development.

Here are some links that showcase my previous work:
