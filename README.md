### Welcome to my GitHub profile

[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=jeremylevasseur&theme=dark)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-levasseur-008209137/)

I am a recent Engineering graduate from Carleton University, and am currently working for Ericsson as a full-time R&D Engineer.

I am also doing freelance software development for individuals and small businesses.

I have experience in mobile development for Android and iOS. I also use React to create interactive web applications.

Linux is my preferred development environment. I then use Docker to run the various applications required within containers.

My favourite languages are Python and JavaScript, but I use Java and Swift often due to mobile development.

Here are some links that showcase my previous work:
