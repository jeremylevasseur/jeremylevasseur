### Welcome to my GitHub profile

[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=jeremylevasseur&theme=dark)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-levasseur-008209137/)

I am currently working as a Research & Development Developer at Ericsson. I graduated from Carleton University in 2021 with a bachelor of Engineering.

In addition to working for Ericsson, I do freelance software development for individuals and small businesses on the side.

I have experience in mobile development for Android and iOS. I also use the MERN tech stack to create interactive web applications.

Linux is my preferred development environment. My favourite languages are Python and JavaScript, but I use Java and Swift often due to mobile development.

You can learn more about me at my [personal website](https://www.jeremylevasseur.com/), or you can see the website I use for [freelance development](https://www.nautilusdevelopment.ca/). Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-levasseur-008209137/).
