I am currently working as an R&D Developer at Ericsson. I graduated from Carleton University in 2021 with a bachelor of Engineering.

I have experience in mobile development for Android and iOS. I also use the MERN tech stack to create interactive web applications.

Linux is my preferred development environment. My favourite languages are Python and JavaScript, but I use Java and Swift often due to mobile development.

Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-levasseur-008209137/).
