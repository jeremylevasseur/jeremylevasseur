[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=jeremylevasseur&theme=dark)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-levasseur-008209137/)

I am currently working as a software developer at Ericsson and as the CTO at [InertialAI](https://www.inertialai.com/). I graduated from Carleton University in 2021 with a bachelor of Engineering.

I have experience in mobile development for Android and iOS. I also use the MERN tech stack to create interactive web applications.

Linux is my preferred development environment. My favourite languages are Python and JavaScript, but I use Java and Swift often due to mobile development.
